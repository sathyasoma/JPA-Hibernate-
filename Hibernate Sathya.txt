Need of hibernate:
===================
Hibernate is used to overcome the limitations of JDBC like:
       
	 * JDBC code is dependent on the database software being used i.e our persistence logic dependent
becase of using jdbc.
     *Here we are inserting a record into Employee table but our quey is database software dependent,
i.e here we are using MySql. but if we change our database then thisquery wont work.

     * if working with jdbc,changing of database suddenly is costly.
	 * jdbc code is not portable across the multiple database software.
	 * In jdbc Exception handling is mandetory.
	 * while working with jdbc, there is no support for object level relationship.
	 * In jdbc there occurs a boilerplate code problem, for every project we have to write that 
code, bcz of that code length is increasing.
     
	 *To overcome those problems we are using "ORM" tool ,i.e nothing but HIbernate Framework.
	      By using hibernate we can avoid above all problems and we can enjoy some other additional
set of functionalities.


About Hibernate:
=================
   Hibernate is a framework that provides "abstraction layer", 
     internally it provide implementation for 
	         Establishing connection with the database 
			            writing the query to perform for CRUD operations
			 
persistence logic: To store and process the data for long use.
==================

Hibernate is opensource,non-invasive,light weight java ORM(Object relational Mapping ) framework 
to develop objects which are independentof the database software and make independent logic in 
all JAVA,JEE.

Functionalities supported by Hibernate;
======================================
=>hibernate framework support for "AUTO DDL" operations.
            in jdbc we have to write the query ,crete and declare table in jdbc
                But hibernate can do all opertaions internally table creationa and alter and drop table.

=>Hibernate can support for"AUTO Primary Key" generation
       But IN Jdbc we have to write the key
=>Hibernate framework is "database independent" it support "HQL"(hibernate query langauge) not 
specific to any database.
      But Jdbc is dependent database.
=>In hibernate is exception handling is not mandetory
      BUt In jdbc is mandetory
=>Hibernate is "ORM" tool means it support object relational mapping.
    But jdbc not dealing with objects, it delaing with values which are primitive 
=>In hibernate each record represented as object
      But in jdbc each record represent with values(primitive data)
=>Hibernate support "Cache memory".
     But jdbc not support.				  


Hibernate:
============
hibernate is framework it is used to develope persistence logic which is independent on database 
software.

Configuration:
===============
configuration is a class which is present in org.hibernate.cfg.package. It "activates" the hibernate
framework. It reads both configuration and mapping files.


SessionFactory:
================
SessionFactory is an "interface" it os used to create "session" object.

 SessionFactory factory=cfg.buildsessionFactory(	);
Session:
=========
Session is an inteface.
   session object is cretaed based on the sessionfactory object i.e factory.
   
 Session session = factory.buildSession();
 
=>it opens the connection and/ session with database throgth hibenate framework.
=>session object is used to perrform CRUD operations.


Transaction:
=============
Transaction is the object whenever we perform some oprations , based on the t operation there is 
some changes in "database".

Query:
=========
Query is na interface
    A Query instance obtained by the calling "session.createQuery()"
 
      Query query=session.createQuery();
